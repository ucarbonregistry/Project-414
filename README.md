# Project-414
Artificial Wetland Groundwater Recharge Project by ZIPL, Gujarat, India

1st RoU Crediting Period: 01/01/2014 to 31/12/2023 (10 years, 00 months)

1st RoU Monitoring Period: 01/01/2014 to 31/12/2023 (10 years, 00 months)

Small Scale Project Inland Wetland Type
Scope 2: Measures for conservation and storage of unutilized water for
future requirements including freshwater ecosystems and wetlands.

Groundwater recharge freshwater wetlands are man-made wetlands
constructed on sandy soils that allow water to gradually percolate through
the soil and recharge the aquifer. The project activity involves several
artificial recharge pits for retaining rainwater runoff and function as artificial
wetlands that helps recharge the groundwater in the area.

The PP showcases efficient methods to replenish depleted groundwater
supplies as a key corporate environmental intervention towards a more
water secure India.

Zydus Cadila, group of companies, is a fully integrated global healthcare and pharmaceutical
provider, which has set up a Pharmaceutical Special Economy Zone (SEZ) called “Pharmez”,
about 25 kilometers from Ahmedabad, Gujarat. The Zydus group has undertaken focused
efforts towards water and wastewater recycling and reuse across all of its operations in India.
The project proponent is M/s. Zydus Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd (ZIPL or PP) who has setup
groundwater recharge wetlands (man-made wetlands) that allow water to gradually percolate
through the soil and recharge the aquifer within the project boundary. The PP has left many
plots vacant within the SEZ to create such recharge wetlands in order to recharge
groundwater with rainwater run-off through natural percolation. These recharge wetlands
also attracts various species of migratory birds, hence helping promote biodiversity within the
project boundary.
